1) Read Chapter 2 of Linux at Olin, available here.
Answer the following reading questions:

    a) What does grep do?
    grep is an application that searches a file for a certain word (or pattern), and prints all the lines that match.

    b) What's the difference between a pipe and a redirect?
    pipe works on the same file that was previously called.
    redirect moves the operation data into a new file.

    c) What's so great about plain text?
    It is transparent and easy to manipulate.

    d) If you rm a file by accident, how do you get it back?
    You can't. It's gone forever. To take some of the sting out of rm, we can use an alias and make the terminal check if you are sure you want to delete.

2) Read Chapter 2 of Think Python and answer the following questions:
    
    a) In script mode, what happens if you put an expression, like math.sin(math.pi) on a line all by itself (without a print statement)?
    The program executes, but there would be no collected result. The data would just disappear.

    b) What is the value of the expression 1.0 / 2.0 * math.pi?  What about 1 / 2 * math.pi?
    1.5707963267948966 (first one)
    0.0 (second one)

    c) Do Exercise 2.4 (Practice using Python as a calculator).  For part 3, consider using Unum.
    1.
        In [1]: r = 5.0

        In [2]: import math

        In [3]: (4/3.0)*math.pi*r**3
        Out[3]: 523.5987755982989

    2.
        In [1]: cover_price = 24.95

        In [2]: discount  = .4

        In [3]: shipping_cost = 3.0

        In [4]: add_shipping = .75

        In [5]: copies = 60

        In [6]: total_cost = copies*cover_price + shipping_cost + (copies-1)*add_shipping

        In [7]: print total_cost
        1544.25

    3. (7.0, 30.100000000000023) = 7:30:06 AM

4) Read Chapter 3 of Am Git and answer these questions:
    a) What is an "untracked" file?
        An untracked file is a file that Git does not keep track of.

    b) Why are files containing object code and executables generally not tracked?
        They are more exclusive to individual computers. Other users wouldn't find them as useful.

    c) In Git vocabulary, what is a remote?
        Remote means that it is somewhere else. A remote copy is a copy that is hosted by a server somewhere else.

6) Read Chapter 3 of Think Python and answer the following questions:
    a) What's the difference between a fruitful function and a void function?
    A fruitful function provides a return. A void function does an action but does not return any data.

    b) What are functions good for anyway?
    They can make code into portable modular blocks. Functions are much easier to debug because you are breaking down a complex program into manageable subcomponents. Functions can also be imported into other scripts.

    c) What are the two forms of the import statement?
    import antigravity
    from antigravity import *
    import antigravity as ag
